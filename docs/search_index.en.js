I've never used CMake with Visual Studio, but I know CMake can generate Visual Studio build files. If you're using visual studio, this may or may not work.\nWindows [Generators]\nYou will need a build system for CMake to generate. Ninja is a common one that is easy to get on most platforms. If you're using mingw, your mingw distribution likely includes a version of make.\nMacOS\nI don't own one nor have I ever developed on one, so I have no idea if cmake even makes sense as a build system.\nFirst steps\nFirst lets see how to set up a basic hello world.\n+-- hello\n|   +-- CMakeLists.txt\n|   +-- src\n|   |   +-- hello.hpp\n|   |   +-- hello.cpp\n\n// hello.hpp\n#pragma once\n\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nnamespace hello{\n    auto greet() {\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Hello world!\\n\"; \n    }\n}\n\n// hello.cpp\n#include \"hello.hpp\"\n\nauto main() -&gt; int {\n    hello::greet();\n    return 0;\n}\n\nNow we can build up our CMakeLists.txt file.\n# Start by specifying the minimum cmake version.\n# To be safe, just use whatever version you get when you run `cmake --version`.\n# This sets the minimum cmake version for anyone trying to build from this cmake file.\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.27.2)\n\n# The project command is used to set a project name, version, included languages, descriptions, and\n# other project information. For now, only a name is necessary.\nproject(hello_proj)\n\n# Next, create an executable target with the `add_executable` command.\nadd_executable(hello)\n\n# Add your source files to your target, to be compiled.\ntarget_sources(hello PRIVATE\n    src/hello.cpp\n)\n\nGenerate your build configuration by running cmake -S . -B build from the top level hello directory. If you get an error, you may need to specify a generator. Remove the build directory generated by cmake before trying again. Here is a list of CMake supported generators. In which case the command will look like one of these:\ncmake -S . -B build -G Ninja\ncmake -S . -B build -G \"MinGW MakeFiles\"\n\nWith your build configuration generated, run cmake --build build. There should be a file in the build directory build/hello(.exe). Execute the file, and you should see Hello world! return in the terminal.\n&gt; build/hello  \n# Hello world!\n\n","id":"https://adamdusty.github.io/posts/cmake/","title":"CMake Intro"}},"docInfo":{"https://adamdusty.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://adamdusty.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://adamdusty.github.io/posts/cmake/":{"body":231,"title":2}},"length":3},"lang":"English"};
